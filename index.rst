InCore Framework Documentation
==============================

Welcome to the InCore Framework Documentation which consists of a complete API reference as well as detailed guides and tutorials.

The InCore Framework offers ready-to-use high-level software blocks ("objects") for building IoT/IIoT applications quickly. InCore Applications configure and link InCore objects based on a declarative `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_-based syntax using the `Qt Modeling Language (QML) <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html>`_. Custom operations and processes can be implemented in `JavaScript <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_ functions easily.
